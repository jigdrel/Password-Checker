# Password Checker

## Overview

Password Checker is a secure web application developed for a cybersecurity assessment. The project demonstrates how secure authentication systems are implemented in practice using modern security techniques such as password hashing, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

The main goal of this project is to protect user accounts from common attacks such as credential theft, brute-force attacks, and unauthorized access.

## Main Features

* User registration and login using email and password
* Secure password hashing using bcrypt
* JWT-based authentication
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
* Role-Based Access Control (Admin and User roles)
* Password strength checking with feedback

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend

* NestJS
* TypeScript
* PostgreSQL
* Prisma ORM
* bcrypt
* JWT
* otplib (for 2FA)

### Frontend

* React
* TypeScript
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* Axios

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* PostgreSQL

---

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file using the provided example:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/password_checker
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
APP_NAME=Password Checker
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Backend runs on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Users can enable 2FA from their dashboard. When enabled:

1. A QR code is generated by the backend
2. The user scans the QR code using an authenticator app
3. The user confirms setup by entering a 6-digit code
4. On future logins, both password and verification code are required

This adds an extra layer of security even if a password is compromised.

---

## Security Considerations

* Passwords are never stored in plain text
* All authentication checks are handled on the backend
* JWT tokens are required for protected routes
* Two-Factor Authentication is enforced server-side

These measures follow common cybersecurity best practices.

## Use of AI Tools

AI tools were used during development to help with debugging and understanding code concepts. All implementation decisions were reviewed and understood by the developer.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how cybersecurity principles can be applied to build a secure authentication system. It focuses on practical security features that are commonly used in real-world applications.
